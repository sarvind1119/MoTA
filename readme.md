Setup and Configuration:

The code imports necessary libraries and modules like OpenAI, Pinecone, and Streamlit for building the app interface.
It initializes connections to Pinecone and OpenAI services using API keys retrieved from environment variables.
Model and Embeddings:

It defines an OpenAI model for text embeddings and initializes an instance of OpenAIEmbeddings with the specified model and API key.
It sets up a vector store using Pinecone for storing and retrieving text embeddings.
Question-Answering Pipeline:

It defines functions for asking questions and retrieving answers using a combination of language models and retrieval mechanisms.
The ask_and_get_answer function uses a retrieval-based QA chain that combines a language model (ChatOpenAI) with a retriever to find relevant answers to questions.
The display_answer function formats and displays the answer along with any relevant source documents.
Main Application Logic:

The main function sets up the Streamlit app interface, allowing users to input queries and get answers displayed on the interface.
When a user inputs a query and clicks the "Ask Query" button, the app invokes the question-answering pipeline to retrieve and display the answer.
User Interface:

The Streamlit app includes a sidebar with information about the app and links to relevant documents.
It provides a text input field for users to enter their queries and a button to trigger the question-answering process.
The answer to the query, along with any associated source documents, is displayed in a structured format on the app interface.
Overall, this code snippet demonstrates the integration of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model with Pinecone for question-answering tasks in a user-friendly Streamlit application.
